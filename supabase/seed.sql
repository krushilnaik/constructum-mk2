-- This file is used to seed the database with initial data.
-- You can add your own seed data here.
--
-- Note: This file is run automatically when you run `supabase start`.
--
-- To avoid errors, make sure that any data you add here does not
-- depend on a user being logged in, as the seeding process runs

-- before any user is created.
--
-- If you need to seed data that depends on a user, you can create a
-- separate script and run it manually after signing up a user in your app.
